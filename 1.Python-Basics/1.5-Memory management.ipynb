    "In Python, data is managed automatically through a private heap, where the interpreter handles allocation and deallocation so you don't have to manually \"save\" or \"replace\" it in the way you might in lower-level languages like C. <br>\n",
    "How Data is Saved (Allocation)<br>\n",
    "When you create a variable (e.g., x = 10), Python doesn't just store the number; it creates an object in memory. <br>\n",
    "Object Creation: Every \"value\" in Python is an object stored in the Heap. This object contains the data value, its type, and a reference count.<br>\n",
    "Names as References: Your variables (like x) are just names stored in the Stack that \"point\" to the object's address on the heap.<br>\n",
    "Optimization (Interning): For small, common objects like integers (-5 to 256) and some strings, Python reuses existing objects in memory instead of creating new ones to save space. <br>\n",
    "How Data is Replaced (Assignment & Deallocation)<br>\n",
    "Python objects are often immutable (like integers, strings, and tuples), meaning they cannot be changed in place. <br>\n",
    "Reassignment: If you have x = 10 and then run x = 11, Python creates a new object for 11 and updates the variable x to point to the new address.<br>\n",
    "Reference Counting: Each object tracks how many variables point to it. When you reassign x, the reference count for the old object 10 drops.<br>\n",
    "Garbage Collection: Once an object's reference count hits zero, Python's Garbage Collector automatically deallocates that memory.<br>\n",
    "Cyclic References: If objects point to each other in a loop, a \"Generational Garbage Collector\" periodically scans the heap to find and clean these up. <br>\n",
    "Pro Tip: While Python manages this for you, you can use sys.getrefcount() to see how many things point to an object, or id() to see its unique memory address<br>"
